"""audit-events query module (§7.2:1108-1126, §16.8:2261-2264).

Owned by ``packages/db/queries``; consumed by analytics-api admin write
endpoints to record one row per mutation per §16.8:2261 ("Write
endpoints log every action to ``audit_events`` with ``actor``,
``before_state``, ``after_state``").

T-401b symbol-map CRUD is the first consumer. Helper ships standalone
in T-401a per L-007 pre-emptive split — alternative (merging
T-401a+T-401b) would overshoot §0.3 LOC cap (~505 LOC vs 400). T-405
audit-log viewer becomes the first reader of the rows this helper
inserts.

The helper writes inside the caller's ``conn.transaction()`` so the
audit row commits atomically with the business mutation; tx rollback
on audit failure rolls back the business write too (§16.8 atomicity
requirement).

    Marked ``@non_idempotent`` per §N3 / §5.8: callers do **not** retry
    on failure — caller is expected to invoke this INSIDE the same
    ``conn.transaction()`` as the business mutation; any failure rolls
    back the mutation too.

    Column order + types match migration 0011 (§7.2:1110-1122). The
    ``before_state`` / ``after_state`` dicts are serialised via
    :func:`json.dumps` (``default=str``: UUID/datetime/Decimal stringify
    safely — §5.3 Decimal precision preserved as ``str(Decimal)``;
    datetime as ``str(dt)`` with explicit ``+00:00`` from the
    ``TIMESTAMPTZ`` source) and cast to ``jsonb`` server-side; the
    default asyncpg codec map does not auto-convert Python dicts to
    ``jsonb``. Mirrors :func:`packages.db.queries.execution.insert_position`
    ``meta`` kwarg convention.

    ``before_state`` is ``None`` for create actions; ``after_state`` is
    ``None`` for delete actions; both non-``None`` for update actions.
    Both ``None`` is allowed at the DB layer but semantically odd —
    callers should set at least one.
